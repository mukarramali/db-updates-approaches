# Transactions 2.0

Safety provided by Transaction is explained by ACID.

A: Atomicity -> Everything or nothing
C: Consistency -> application in good state -> Certain statements are always true -> Wasn't DB responsibility
I: Isolation -> A Transaction runs as if its the only one
D: Durability -> Committed data is persistent -> in Hardware/enough nodes

One database' idea of ACID can be different from other.
